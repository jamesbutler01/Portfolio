# Portfolio
I'm a Computational Neuroscientist at University College London (UCL). My work focuses on how neural networks encode information, particularly with respect to value. 

Please find here a few examples my research projects.

## Contents

 - ### Machine learning
    - #### Supervised learning
        - [Neurons encode the value of objects using a linear scale](https:github.com): Modelling neuron firing rates within a network reveals individual neurons  ramp their firing rates depending on the value of the object they are viewing
    - 


- ### Data processing
    -  [Extracting discrete eye movements from continuous eye tracking data](https://github.com/jamesbutler01/Portfolio/blob/main/Processing%20eye%20data/eye%20tracking%20analysis.ipynb): Cleaning of noisy eye tracking recordings of eye x and y positions  to extract the discrete eye movements ('saccades') that occur.
