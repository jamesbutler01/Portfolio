# Portfolio
Please find here a few examples of my work as a Computational Neuroscientist at University College London (UCL). My work focuses on how neural networks encode information, particularly with respect to value. 

Everything is original, independent work I have completed that has been (or will be) submitted to high impact peer-reviewed journals. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions!

 - ### Machine learning
    - #### Supervised learning
	- [Neurons can encode the value of multiple objects simultaneously](https://github.com/jamesbutler01/Portfolio/blob/main/Simultaneous%20value%20coding/neuron%20value%20coding.ipynb): Modelling firing rates using GLMs and statistics reveals neurons in the brain can respond to the value of at least 4 different objects in our peripheral vision, simultaneously.
        - [Using logistic regression to predict where a monkey will look](https:github.com): Model comparison of different independent variables demonstrated that the value of objects in our peripheral vision influences where we will next look.
        - [Decoding what a monkey will choose using SVM](https:github.com): Neural activity in certain regions predicts what option an monkey will choose trial-by-trial, as evidenced by SVM decoding on neural firing rates.
     - #### Unsupervised learning
        -  [Dimensionality reduction to reveal how neural networks encoding information](https:github.com): Using PCA and correlation matrices, I demonstrate that neurons can rotate their encoding of information to orthogonalize it when necessary.
        -  [Quantifying the extent of clustering within a neural network](https:github.com): Measurement of the angle of information coding between neurons (PAIRs) in a high dimensional state space to quantify the amount that neuron responses within a network are clustered. 


- ### Data processing
    -  [Extracting discrete eye movements from continuous eye tracking data](https://github.com/jamesbutler01/Portfolio/blob/main/Processing%20eye%20data/eye%20tracking%20analysis.ipynb): Processing of noisy eye-tracking data (eye x and y positions recorded at 1 kHz) to extract the discrete eye movements ('saccades') that occur. 


- ### Software engineering
    -  [Standalone Android platform for automated behavioural testing](https://github.com/jamesbutler01/Mymou): Android app that allows monkeys to play games in their enclosures. It using facial recognition while they play via a custom-built neural network to identify which monkey is playing when and adjusts the difficulty accordingly. Now used in multiple centres around the world, awarded the [UCL 3Rs prize for Innovation](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biological-services/news/2018/may/ucl-celebrates-3rs-may-2018)  and [funding to expand the scheme throughout England](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/refining-training-non-human-primates-using-automated-home-room-training-systems).
