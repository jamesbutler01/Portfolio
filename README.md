# Portfolio
I'm a Computational Neuroscientist at University College London (UCL). My work focuses on how neural networks encode information, particularly with respect to value. 

Please find here a few examples of the kind of research that I do.

## Contents

 - ### Machine learning

    - [Supervised learing: Neurons encode the value of objects using a linear scale](https:github.com): Modelling how neurons respond when viewing objects of different value reveals that they ramp their firing rates depending on the value of the object
    - 


- ### Data processing
    -  [Extracting discrete eye movements from continuous eye tracking data](https://github.com/jamesbutler01/Portfolio/blob/main/Processing%20eye%20data/eye%20tracking%20analysis.ipynb): Cleaning of noisy continuous eye tracking recordings of an eye's x and y position in order to extract the discrete eye movements ('saccades') that occur.
